# Number Guesser Game
A game of "hot and cold" with guessing a number.

## Level One
In level one, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10 and the user has 3 guesses to pick the correct number. The computer will tell you if you are too high or too low.

## Level Two
In level two, the game is reversed and the user picks a number and the computer then has 3 guesses to select the correct answer.

## Level Three
In level three, the computer's guesses are optimized to refine the range on the guesses based on whether they are too high or too low. Print how many guesses it takes computer before it correctly guesses the number.

## Level Four
In level four, give the user an option to play against the computer or to think of a number for the computer to guess.
